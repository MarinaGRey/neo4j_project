# Neo4j Movie and Galaxy Network Graph Database

This project was made in collaboration with [mariamagro](https://github.com/mariamagro) for the Databases subject in the Carlos III university.

This project focuses on creating and querying a graph database using Neo4j. The database models both a fictional galaxy with planets and political affiliations, and a network of people, movies, and their relationships.

## 🚀 Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of Neo4j, a graph database, to model two datasets:
1. A fictional galaxy with planets, political systems, and regions.
2. A network of people and movies, where people can act in or direct movies, recommend movies to each other, and have friendships.

The project explores various graph-based queries, including shortest path searches, aggregation of nodes, and relationships between people, movies, and planets.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is divided into two exercises:
1. **Exercise 1**: Queries related to a fictional galaxy with planets, political systems, and regions.
2. **Exercise 2**: A social network of people connected to movies they have acted in, directed, or recommended.

## 📝 Exercise 1: Galaxy Graph Queries

In this exercise, we model a galaxy where planets are connected to regions, political systems, and neighboring planets. Queries are written to retrieve various insights, such as shortest paths, dominant political systems, and region statistics.

## 🏙️ Exercise 2: Movie and Person Network
In this exercise, we model a network of people and movies. People can act in or direct movies, recommend movies to others, and be friends with each other.
